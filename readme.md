# Arduino library template
The library just changes the state of the pin passed, wich means this example just makes e.g a led blink on pin 13.

## Usage
under settings in the arduino editor, change the location of the *sketch book* to this repository folder. Then open the *_libTemplate.ino* file and run for an example.

### License
See the *license.md* file.
